# Part 1

def unique_total a
  # ADD YOUR CODE HERE
  # takes an array of integers as an argument and then returns the
  # sum of unique elements in the array. The sum of an empty array is zero.

end

def highest_frequency a
  # ADD YOUR CODE HERE
  # # which takes an array of integers as an argument and
  # returns the element with highest frequency. If there is a tie, return the smallest
  # element. For empty array, return -1.

end

def check_sum? a, n
  # ADD YOUR CODE HERE
  # that takes an array of integers and an additional integer, n, as arguments
  # and returns true if any two elements in the array of integers sum
  # to n. checkSum?([], n) should return false for any value of n, by definition.

end

# Part 2

def custom_concat s
  # ADD YOUR CODE HERE
  # takes a string as an argument and returns the string
  # "Welcome, " concatenated at the beginning of the input string.

end

def initial_consonant? s
  # ADD YOUR CODE HERE
  # takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean
  # value. It is true if it starts with a consonant and false otherwise. (Any character
  # other than a vowel is a consonant) This method should work for both uppercase
  # and lowercase strings. Return false if string is empty or null.

end

def divisible_by_n? n,s
  # ADD YOUR CODE HERE
  # takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean
  # value. It is true if the string represents a binary number that is exactly divisible by
  # ‘n’ and false otherwise. It should return false even if the argument is not a valid
  # binary number.
